::: {#hero-heading}

My research interests lie in the field of applied bayesian econometrics, monetary policy and energy economics. I have been actively researching topics such as energy price regulation, and energy market modeling. 

I have been awarded the National Scholarship , First-Class Academic Scholarship , and the title of Outstanding Student (Merit Student) , among other honors. I graduated as the top student in my major and was directly admitted to a Master‚Äôs program through academic recommendation. In addition, I won an Honorable Mention (H Prize) in the MCM/ICM Mathematical Contest in Modeling organized by COMAP, and secured the First Prize at the Beijing Level in the National College Students Mathematics Competition .

I like fitness, running, music (a self-proclaimed Jay Chou fan)Ôºå and chess. Welcome to play chess with me!
